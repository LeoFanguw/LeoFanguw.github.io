In recent years, **NFTs mania** has become a social phenomenon that attracts attention from different fields, however, people still know a little about the whole marketplace. **NFTs** is exactly an *innovation* which will bring changes in relationship between users and digital space, due to its usage as **electronic certificates**. In order to interpret the social interactions built between **users** and **NFTs**, this project will attempt to visualize the real **NFTs market** in the past few years.


## Definition of Non-Fungible Token
NFT represents a new phenomenon using block chain technology to certify ownership of digital objects in the digital world, and allows users to trade digital objects as the physical objects (Dowling 2022).

## Social Interactions Defined
Between the relationship among digital space and users, the most obvious feature is large global communities are allowed to be connected around in a short period, because digital space allows people to create complex networks ignoring physical distances. The second feature among digital space and users appears when the large global communities are created, people then tend to form micro-communities that share highly specialized interests under the big categories, and this also shows the social division in digital space.

## Methodology
This project will use data collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), then visualize the data in a meaningful way to convince audiences about the fact.
